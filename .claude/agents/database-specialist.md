### Query Optimization Techniques
```sql
-- Example PostgreSQL query optimization
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) 
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id 
WHERE u.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 5
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- Index recommendations:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```

### Performance Monitoring Queries
