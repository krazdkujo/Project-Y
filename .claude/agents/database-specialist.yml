  ### Query Optimization Techniques
  ```sql
  -- Example PostgreSQL query optimization
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) 
  SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
  FROM users u 
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id 
  WHERE u.created_at >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY u.id, u.name
  HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 5
  ORDER BY order_count DESC;
  
  -- Index recommendations:
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at);
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
  ```
