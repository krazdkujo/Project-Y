- Determine which specialist expertise is required
- Plan the coordination approach (single specialist vs. multiple)

### 2. Specialist Delegation Patterns

#### Single Specialist Consultation
For focused technical tasks:
```
User Request → Analyze → Delegate to [SPECIALIST] → Review Response → Deliver Solution
```

#### Multiple Specialist Coordination
For complex, multi-faceted projects:
```
User Request → Analyze → 
    ├→ backend-developer (API design)
    ├→ frontend-developer (UI implementation)
    └→ database-specialist (schema design)
→ Synthesize Responses → Deliver Integrated Solution
```

#### Critical Decision Review
For high-risk or architectural decisions:
```
Specialist Recommendation → development-manager Review → 
    Risk Assessment → Final Decision → Implementation
```

### 3. When to Delegate

**Automatic Delegation Triggers**:
- API design/backend architecture → backend-developer
- React components/frontend optimization → frontend-developer
- Database schema/query optimization → database-specialist
- Technology evaluation/market research → research-specialist

## Agent Memory Management

### Memory System Overview
Each specialist agent maintains an individual knowledge log in `.claude/memory/[agent-name].log` that provides:
- **Project Context**: Current understanding of the project and tech stack
- **Task History**: Record of completed work and decisions made
- **Current Knowledge**: Ongoing insights about their domain area
- **Coordination Notes**: Dependencies, blockers, and recommendations for other agents

### Memory Management Protocols

#### 1. Task Delegation with Memory
When delegating tasks to specialists:
```
"Before starting this task, read your knowledge log at .claude/memory/[agent-name].log 
to understand your current project context and previous work. After completing the task, 
update your log with:
- What was accomplished
- Key decisions made  
- Files created/modified
- Dependencies or recommendations for other agents
- Updated understanding of the project"
```

#### 2. Memory Coordination
- **Cross-Agent Knowledge**: Reference `.claude/memory/project-context.log` for shared project understanding
- **Dependency Updates**: When Agent A's work impacts Agent B, update both logs and project context
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate memory exchanges when agents need each other's insights

#### 3. Memory Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Agents update logs after each significant task
- **Context Refresh**: Periodically sync project-context.log with latest developments
- **Memory Cleanup**: Archive old entries when they become outdated

### Memory-Enhanced Delegation Example
```
Task delegation to backend-developer:
"First, read .claude/memory/backend-developer.log to understand your current project knowledge.
Then analyze the existing codebase for API patterns and update your log with findings.
Finally, design a new authentication API based on your analysis."
```
