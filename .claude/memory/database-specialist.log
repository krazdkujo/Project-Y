=== DATABASE-SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE LOG ===
Last Updated: 2025-08-18T16:45:00Z

## CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT
- Project: 8-Player ASCII Roguelike with MUD-inspired tick system
- Working Directory: C:\Dev\New Test
- Status: Planning complete, awaiting client decisions for Week 2 database implementation
- Tech Stack: Supabase PostgreSQL, Redis, Node.js, TypeScript, Real-time subscriptions
- Architecture: Real-time multiplayer game with session-based party management

## NEW PROJECT UNDERSTANDING
### Core Game Systems Requiring Database Design
1. **Leveless Skill Progression**: Characters advance through 0-100 skill levels across multiple disciplines
2. **Session-Based Party Management**: Temporary 8-player groups with real-time coordination
3. **Tick-Based Combat System**: Action queuing and turn management with precise timing
4. **Character Persistence**: Player progress maintained across game sessions
5. **Combat Analytics**: Comprehensive logging and statistical analysis

### Database Architecture Strategy
- **Primary Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL for persistent game data
- **Session Cache**: Redis for real-time state management and tick timers
- **Security Model**: Row-level security for multi-tenant game sessions
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase subscriptions for live game updates

## ROGUELIKE DATABASE DESIGN APPROACH

### Schema Design Philosophy
1. **Performance-First Design**: Optimized for real-time multiplayer with sub-100ms response times
2. **Flexible Skill System**: JSONB storage for dynamic skill progression without rigid level constraints
3. **Session Isolation**: Row-level security ensuring game sessions remain isolated from each other
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete action logging for anti-cheat and gameplay analysis
5. **Scalability**: Designed for thousands of concurrent players across multiple game sessions

### Key Performance Considerations
- **Hot Path Optimization**: Critical game queries (movement, combat, skills) must execute in <50ms
- **Redis Integration**: Session state, action queues, and tick timers cached for instant access
- **Connection Pooling**: Supabase connection management for sustained concurrent load
- **Index Strategy**: Covering indexes for character lookups, session queries, and skill calculations
- **Partitioning**: Combat logs and action history partitioned by date for long-term performance

### Scaling Concerns & Solutions
1. **Concurrent Player Load**: 
   - Problem: 8 players per session Ã— multiple sessions = high concurrent write load
   - Solution: Redis for hot data, PostgreSQL for persistence, optimistic locking for conflicts

2. **Skill Calculation Performance**:
   - Problem: Complex skill progression calculations on every action
   - Solution: Materialized skill totals with incremental updates, cached in Redis

3. **Real-time Synchronization**:
   - Problem: 8 players need instant updates on all actions
   - Solution: Supabase real-time subscriptions with Redis pub/sub for low-latency coordination

4. **Combat Log Volume**:
   - Problem: Detailed action logging generates massive data volume
   - Solution: Time-based partitioning, automated archival, summary tables for analytics

### Database Files to Create (Week 2)
- **/database/schema.sql**: Core game schema with character, session, and combat tables
- **/database/migrations/**: Versioned schema changes and data transformations  
- **/src/database/supabase-client.ts**: Type-safe Supabase integration with connection pooling
- **/src/database/redis-client.ts**: Redis session management and caching layer

## PREVIOUS TASKS COMPLETED
### 2025-08-17 - Initial System Deployment  
- What: Agent system deployment and database specialization setup
- Decisions: Established as specialist for database architecture and optimization
- Files: Agent configuration in .claude/agents/database-specialist.yml
- Next: Awaiting database analysis and optimization tasks

### 2025-08-18 - Complete Database Schema Design (Previous Project)
- What: Designed comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema for user management system
- Decisions: PostgreSQL chosen for ACID compliance, JSON support, and advanced indexing
- Files Created:
  - database/schema/01_initial_schema.sql - Core schema with 15 tables and triggers
  - database/indexes/02_performance_indexes.sql - 50+ optimized performance indexes
  - database/migrations/03_gdpr_compliance.sql - GDPR compliance functions and procedures
  - database/seeds/04_initial_data.sql - Production-ready seed data and test users
  - database/README.md - Comprehensive documentation and usage guide
  - database/package.json - Database project configuration and scripts

## ROGUELIKE DATABASE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Core Schema Tables (Planned)
1. **Players Table**: Account management with authentication and global player stats
2. **Characters Table**: Individual character profiles with JSONB skills progression
3. **Game_Sessions Table**: 8-player party instances with session state and settings
4. **Session_Players Table**: Player-session relationships with join/leave tracking
5. **Action_Queue Table**: Queued player actions awaiting tick processing
6. **Combat_Instances Table**: Active combat state for coordinated battle resolution
7. **Combat_Logs Table**: Detailed action history for analysis and anti-cheat detection
8. **Skill_Definitions Table**: Configurable skill types and progression formulas

### Performance Architecture
- **Hot Path Caching**: Character skills, session state, action queues cached in Redis
- **Strategic Indexing**: Covering indexes for character lookups, session queries, skill calculations
- **Partitioned Logs**: Combat and action logs partitioned by month for query performance
- **Materialized Views**: Skill summaries and leaderboards for dashboard queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Supabase connection management for sustained load

### Real-time Synchronization Strategy
- **Supabase Subscriptions**: Real-time character and session updates via PostgreSQL triggers
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: Action coordination and tick notifications for low-latency responses
- **Optimistic Locking**: Conflict resolution for simultaneous skill updates and combat actions
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete action history for replay, debugging, and anti-cheat analysis

### Security & Isolation
- **Row-Level Security**: Game sessions isolated using Supabase RLS policies
- **Player Authentication**: Secure session tokens with character access validation
- **Anti-Cheat Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for detecting impossible actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Action throttling to prevent spam and ensure fair gameplay

### Scaling Considerations
- **Skill Calculation Cache**: Pre-computed skill totals with incremental updates
- **Session Load Balancing**: Distribute active sessions across database connections
- **Archive Strategy**: Historical data moved to cold storage after 90 days
- **Analytics Aggregation**: Summary tables for dashboard and statistics without full table scans
