# Documentation Specialist Memory Log
# Project: JWT Authentication System
# Created: 2025-08-18

## Project Overview
The system consists of a comprehensive authentication architecture with:
- Node.js/Express TypeScript backend with JWT authentication
- React TypeScript frontend with context-based state management
- PostgreSQL database with RBAC and GDPR compliance
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security features including rate limiting, password hashing, and audit trails

## System Architecture Analysis
### Backend Components:
- Express.js with TypeScript
- JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- Rate limiting (100 req/15min global, 5 req/15min auth)
- Helmet.js security headers
- Winston structured logging
- Joi input validation
- CORS configuration

### Frontend Components:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- React Router for navigation
- TanStack React Query for data fetching
- Context API for auth state management
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Comprehensive form validation

### Database Schema:
- PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- Users table with soft delete for GDPR
- RBAC system (roles, permissions, mappings)
- Authentication tokens (refresh, reset, verification)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- GDPR compliance tracking
- API usage monitoring

## Documentation Standards Applied:
- Task-oriented information architecture
- Progressive disclosure for complex concepts
- Plain language principles
- Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Security-focused documentation
- Accessibility considerations throughout
- Multi-audience approach (developers, operators, users)
