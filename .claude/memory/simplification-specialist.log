## TEAM COLLABORATION INSIGHTS
### Development Manager Requirements:
- Must work within quality gates framework
- Requires Simplification Assessment Reports (SAR) for recommendations
- Cannot override security, performance, or compliance requirements
- Focus on measurable complexity reduction

### Research Specialist Findings:
- Vercel > AWS for frontend/full-stack deployment simplicity
- Vite > Webpack for build tool developer experience
- Supabase > Firebase for PostgreSQL-based backend development
- Bun consideration for greenfield projects vs Node.js

### Backend Developer Guidance:
- Prefer managed services over custom implementations
- Focus on convention over configuration patterns
- Emphasize serverless and managed database solutions
- Maintain quality through TypeScript and automated testing

### UI-UX Designer Framework:
- Ensure simplification improves user experience, not just developer experience
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Focus on cognitive load reduction for both developers and users
- Validate changes with real user testing when possible

## SPECIALIZATION FOCUS
- Technology stack optimization for developer experience
- Complexity assessment using quantitative scoring framework
- Managed service evaluation vs custom implementations
- Developer workflow optimization
- Quality-preserving simplification strategies

## SIMPLIFICATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ASCII ROGUELIKE
### Critical Path Simplifications (Strong Recommendations):
**1. Player Count Reduction: 8 → 4 players for MVP (Complexity Reduction: 2 points)**
- Benefits: Significantly reduces testing burden, state synchronization complexity
- Preserves: Core multiplayer innovation and tactical coordination
- Timeline Impact: -2 weeks development time, enables proper testing

**2. Turn Timer Simplification: Configurable → Fixed timing (Complexity Reduction: 1 point)**
- Benefits: Reduces configuration complexity, simplifies game balance
- Preserves: MUD-inspired turn-based mechanics
- Implementation: Start with 30-second fixed turns, add configurability post-MVP

**3. AI Takeover Scope: Full AI → Basic automation (Complexity Reduction: 1 point)**
- Benefits: Reduces AI complexity, focuses on core multiplayer experience
- Preserves: Seamless player experience during disconnections
- Implementation: Simple "hold position" or "basic attack" behaviors initially

### Architecture Optimizations (Conditional Recommendations):
**4. Real-time Communication: Consider polling hybrid approach**
- Benefits: Reduces WebSocket complexity for non-critical updates
- Trade-off: Slightly higher latency for some interactions
- Recommendation: WebSocket for actions, polling for status updates

**5. ASCII Interface: Progressive enhancement strategy**
- Benefits: Start with web-based ASCII, add mobile considerations later
- Preserves: Core ASCII aesthetic and accessibility
- Timeline: Focus on desktop experience for MVP

## DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY STRATEGY
### Complexity Budget Management:
- **Current Complexity Score**: 10/15 (Technical: 4, Config: 3, Operational: 3)
- **Target MVP Score**: 7/15 (Technical: 3, Config: 2, Operational: 2)
- **Reduction Strategy**: Focus on player count and timing system simplifications

### Timeline Optimization:
- **Week 1-2**: Core 4-player game mechanics with fixed timing
- **Week 3-4**: WebSocket implementation and basic AI automation
- **Week 5-6**: Game content and balancing
- **Week 7-8**: Testing, polish, and accessibility compliance

### Quality Safeguards Maintained:
- Real-time gameplay experience preserved
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Skill-based progression system intact
- Core MUD-inspired innovation delivered

## COORDINATION NOTES
- Dependencies: Working with team to validate simplification recommendations
- Current Status: Awaiting client decision on MVP scope adjustments
- Risk Mitigation: Complexity reduction focused on technical implementation, not core gameplay
- Success Metrics: 8-week timeline achievable with 4-player MVP approach

## NEXT STEPS
1. Provide detailed SAR (Simplification Assessment Report) for 4-player recommendation
2. Collaborate with Backend Developer on WebSocket vs polling hybrid approach
3. Work with UI-UX Designer on progressive ASCII interface enhancement strategy
4. Support Development Manager with revised timeline estimates based on simplifications
