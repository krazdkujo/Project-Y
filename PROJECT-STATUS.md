- `02-COMBAT-AND-D20-MECHANICS.md` - Core gameplay systems and balance
- `03-8PLAYER-COORDINATION.md` - Multiplayer mechanics and social features

**Critical Decisions Needed:**
- Player @ symbol color assignments (8 colors for 8 players)
- Monster ASCII character set (g, o, T, D, etc.)
- D20 combat mechanics (initiative, damage, critical hits)
- 8-player coordination systems (leadership, loot distribution)
- Turn timer behavior and AI takeover rules

### 3. ASCII Design Guide
**File**: `docs/ASCII-DESIGN-GUIDE.md`
- Complete character and symbol reference
- 8-player color scheme
- Monster classification system
- Environment and terrain symbols
- Item and equipment representation
- Mobile and accessibility considerations

### 4. MVP Development Roadmap
**File**: `docs/MVP-ROADMAP.md`
- 8-week timeline to playable MVP
- Parallel development streams (Backend, Frontend, Database, QA)
- Week-by-week deliverables and milestones
- Risk mitigation and contingency plans
- Success criteria and technical benchmarks

### 5. Project Structure
**Folders Created:**

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Innovation Summary

### Unique Combination of Systems
1. **MUD Tick Architecture** adapted for modern web technology
2. **Leveless Skill Progression** (no character levels, only skill advancement)
3. **8-Player ASCII Coordination** in turn-based format
4. **D20 Combat** with skill-based modifiers
5. **Configurable Turn Timers** (1 minute to 1 day)
6. **Server-Authoritative** with AI takeover for disconnected players

### Technical Architecture Highlights
- **WebSocket** for real-time 8-player coordination
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for persistent character data
- **Redis** for active session state and turn timers
- **Vercel Serverless** for scalable backend functions
- **ASCII Terminal Interface** with color-coded characters

## ðŸš¨ Critical Path: Client Decisions Required

**BLOCKING DEVELOPMENT**: The following decisions must be made before development can proceed:

### Immediate Priority (Week 1)
1. **ASCII Character Colors** - Which colors for which player types/races?
2. **Monster Representation** - Approve or modify the proposed character set
3. **D20 Combat Rules** - Initiative, critical hits, damage calculation
4. **Turn Timer Behavior** - What happens when timers expire?

### High Priority (Week 2)
1. **8-Player Leadership** - How should groups make decisions?
2. **Loot Distribution** - Individual vs shared vs voted allocation?
3. **AI Quality** - How smart should AI substitution be?
4. **Combat Balance** - Difficulty scaling for 8-player groups?

### Medium Priority (Week 3)
1. **Communication Tools** - Chat features and coordination systems
2. **Session Management** - Persistence and reconnection rules
3. **Skill Progression** - XP curves and advancement rates

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### For Client (Immediate)
1. **Review all question documents** in `client-decisions/questions/`
2. **Provide answers** in `client-decisions/answers/` folder
3. **Prioritize decisions** by urgency (what's needed first?)
4. **Schedule follow-up** for any complex decisions requiring discussion

### For Development Team (Week 2)
1. **Wait for client decisions** on core mechanics
2. **Set up development environment** (Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase)
3. **Begin basic infrastructure** with reasonable defaults
4. **Plan parallel development streams** based on client priorities

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept Validation

### What We're Building
- **8-player parties** explore ASCII dungeons together
- **No character levels** - only skill advancement through use
- **Turn-based D20 combat** with configurable timing (1min to 1 day turns)
- **MUD-style reliability** with modern web interface
- **ASCII @ symbols** represent players, lowercase letters are monsters
- **Asynchronous coordination** allows flexible scheduling for large groups

### Why This Is Unique
- **First MUD-inspired web roguelike** with modern multiplayer features
- **Largest turn-based party size** (8 players) in roguelike genre
- **Flexible timing** accommodates both quick sessions and long-term strategy
- **Skill-based progression** without traditional leveling restrictions
- **ASCII aesthetic** provides nostalgic appeal with modern functionality
