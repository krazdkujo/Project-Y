# ASCII Design Guide: Character and Symbol Reference

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Purpose**: Complete reference for ASCII character representation in the roguelike game

## üéØ Design Philosophy

This ASCII design system prioritizes:
- **Clarity**: Each symbol should be instantly recognizable
- **Consistency**: Related entities use similar visual patterns
- **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly with symbol + color combinations
- **Scalability**: Works on both mobile and desktop displays

## üë§ Player Character System

### Base Symbol: @ (Commercial At)
All players use the `@` symbol with color differentiation for identification.

Player 4: Yellow @  (#FFAA00) - Cleric/Divine theme
Player 5: Purple @  (#AA00FF) - Sorcerer/Arcane theme
Player 6: Cyan @    (#00AAAA) - Bard/Social theme
Player 7: Orange @  (#FF6600) - Paladin/Justice theme
Player 8: White @   (#FFFFFF) - Ranger/Versatile theme
```

### Player Status Indicators (Optional)

## üì± Responsive Design Considerations

### Mobile Adaptations
- Minimum font size: 14px for ASCII characters
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum for interactive elements
- High contrast mode available
- Zoom capability for detailed viewing

### Accessibility Features
- Color + symbol combinations (never color alone)
- High contrast mode option
- Colorblind-friendly palette
- Screen reader compatible alt-text for symbols

---

## üéÆ Implementation Notes

### Rendering Priorities
1. **Player characters** - Always visible, highest priority
2. **Monsters** - High priority, combat-relevant
3. **Interactive objects** - Medium priority, context-dependent
4. **Environment** - Low priority, background elements

### Animation Guidelines
- **Static by default** - ASCII characters don't move
- **Blinking effects** - For status changes (damage, effects)
- **Color transitions** - For state changes (health, magic)
- **Positional updates** - Only during turn resolution

### Symbol Conflicts Resolution
If two entities occupy the same space:
1. Player characters override everything
2. Monsters override objects and terrain
3. Interactive objects override static environment
4. Use background color to indicate hidden elements

---

## üîÑ Dynamic Elements

### Turn-Based Updates
```
During player turns:
- Current player @ symbol highlighted (brighter color)
- Available movement squares highlighted
- Target highlighting for attacks/spells

During AI turns:
- Monster symbols briefly highlighted during actions
- Spell effects shown with temporary symbols
- Damage numbers as temporary overlay text
```

### Status Overlays
```
Health indicators:
- Green background = Full health
- Yellow background = Injured  
- Red background = Critical
- Black background = Unconscious/Dead

Magic effects:
- Blue outline = Magical enhancement
- Purple outline = Spell targeting
- Red outline = Harmful effect
```
