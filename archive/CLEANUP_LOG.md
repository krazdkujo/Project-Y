# Documentation Cleanup Log

**Cleanup Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Performed By**: AI Project Coordinator  
**Reason**: Transition from MUD/tick-based to real-time AP system complete

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Files Archived**

### **Outdated Game Design Documents**
The following documents contained references to the old MUD/tick-based architecture that has been replaced with our real-time AP system:

```bash
# Moved to archive/outdated-docs/
- CORE-SPECIFICATION.md (MUD-inspired tick system)
- ADOM-INSPIRED-MECHANICS.md (Ancient Domains of Mystery mechanics)
- APPROVED-MECHANICS.md (Tick-based combat mechanics)
- UPDATED-CORE-SPECIFICATION.md (Outdated specification)
- GAME_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md (MUD architecture references)
- PROJECT-STATUS.md (Old status before current implementation)
```

### **Reasons for Archival**

#### **CORE-SPECIFICATION.md & UPDATED-CORE-SPECIFICATION.md**
- **Issue**: Referenced MUD-style tick system architecture
- **Current Reality**: Implemented real-time WebSocket-based AP system
- **Impact**: These documents would confuse developers about current architecture

#### **ADOM-INSPIRED-MECHANICS.md**
- **Issue**: Ancient Domains of Mystery mechanics not applicable to current design
- **Current Reality**: Custom tactical AP system with D20 mechanics
- **Impact**: Outdated mechanics that don't match implemented systems

#### **APPROVED-MECHANICS.md**
- **Issue**: Tick-based combat approval that was superseded
- **Current Reality**: Real-time tactical combat with initiative order
- **Impact**: Could mislead feature development decisions

#### **PROJECT-STATUS.md**
- **Issue**: Outdated status from early development phases
- **Current Reality**: Production-ready system with comprehensive features
- **Impact**: Replaced by PROJECT_STATUS_CURRENT.md with accurate information

## üéØ **Documentation Standards Going Forward**

### **Document Lifecycle Management**

#### **Active Documents**
- **Purpose**: Currently implemented features and systems
- **Update Frequency**: As features are modified or extended
- **Ownership**: Assigned to specific team members
- **Review**: Monthly review for accuracy and relevance

#### **Future Feature Documents**
- **Purpose**: Planned features with detailed specifications
- **Status**: Clearly marked as "Planned" or "Future Implementation"
- **Priority**: Labeled with development phase (Phase 2, 3, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisites and technical requirements

#### **Archive Criteria**
Documents are archived when:
- Architecture or implementation approach fundamentally changes
- Features are deprecated or replaced with new systems
- Technical debt cleanup removes legacy code they describe
- Six months pass without updates and they're no longer relevant

### **Documentation Quality Standards**

#### **Required Elements**
```markdown
# Document Header Requirements
- **Status**: Active | Planned | Archived
- **Last Updated**: Date of last modification
- **Owner**: Responsible team member
- **Dependencies**: Related systems or documents
- **Implementation Status**: Complete | In Progress | Not Started
```

#### **Content Standards**
- **Technical Accuracy**: Must match current implementation
- **Context7 Integration**: Reference appropriate documentation sources
- **Code Examples**: Use actual project code snippets
- **Testing Information**: Include validation and testing procedures
- **Performance Metrics**: Specify measurable success criteria

---

## üîç **Future Cleanup Schedule**

### **Monthly Review Process**
```bash
# First Monday of each month
‚ñ° Review all active documentation for accuracy
‚ñ° Check for outdated implementation details
‚ñ° Validate Context7 references are current
‚ñ° Archive documents that are no longer relevant
‚ñ° Update roadmap and status documents
```

### **Major Version Cleanup**
```bash
# At each major release
‚ñ° Archive previous version specifications
‚ñ° Update all technical architecture documents
‚ñ° Consolidate feature documentation
‚ñ° Review and update team training materials
‚ñ° Clean up testing and deployment procedures
```

### **Quarterly Architecture Review**
```bash
# Every three months
‚ñ° Review entire documentation structure
‚ñ° Identify gaps in documentation coverage
‚ñ° Plan documentation for upcoming features
‚ñ° Update team responsibilities and ownership
‚ñ° Validate external dependency documentation
```
