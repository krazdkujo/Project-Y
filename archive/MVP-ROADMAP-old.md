## üö® Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **8-Player Coordination Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler coordination, build up
   - Fallback: Reduce to 4-6 players if needed

2. **Real-Time Multiplayer Stability**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, graceful degradation
   - Fallback: Turn-based only mode

3. **Client Decision Delays**
   - Mitigation: Use reasonable defaults, plan buffer time
   - Fallback: Implement with defaults, adjust later

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **ASCII Interface Complexity**
2. **Combat Balance**
3. **Performance Under Load**

### Contingency Plans
- **Week 6 Go/No-Go Decision**: Assess if MVP will be ready
