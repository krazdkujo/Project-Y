## ‚öîÔ∏è D20 Combat Resolution

### Question 1.1: Attack Resolution System

**RECOMMENDED ANSWERS:**

1. **Attack Formula Approval**: YES - The d20 + floor(Combat_Skill / 4) formula is excellent for skill-based progression without levels.
   
2. **Weapon Type Skills**: YES - Use separate skills:
   - **Melee Combat** (swords, axes, maces, polearms)
   - **Ranged Combat** (bows, crossbows, throwing weapons)
   - **Magic Combat** (spells, wands, staves)
   
3. **Critical Hits**: YES - Natural 20s deal double damage and always hit regardless of AC.

4. **Critical Failures**: YES - Natural 1s always miss and trigger minor complications:
   - Melee: Weapon gets stuck, lose next attack
   - Ranged: Drop/break ammunition  
   - Magic: Spell backfire, lose mana

5. **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Roll twice, take higher/lower. Triggered by:
   - Advantage: Flanking, surprise, beneficial positioning
   - Disadvantage: Prone, blinded, disadvantageous positioning

### Question 1.2: Damage and Health System

**RECOMMENDED ANSWERS:**

1. **Damage Calculation**: **Option D - Hybrid**
   ```
   Damage = Base Weapon Damage + floor(Combat_Skill / 10)
   ```
   - Short Sword: 4 + skill modifier
   - Battleaxe: 8 + skill modifier  
   - Longbow: 6 + skill modifier

2. **Weapon Damage Ranges**: YES - Different weapons have different base damage:
   - Light weapons (4-6): Fast, skill-dependent
   - Medium weapons (6-8): Balanced damage/speed
   - Heavy weapons (8-12): High damage, slower

3. **Character Health**: Skill-based scaling:
   ```
   Health = 30 + (Defense_Skill √ó 2) + (Constitution_Skill √ó 1)
   Range: 30 (new character) to 530 (maxed skills)
   ```

4. **Temporary Hit Points**: NO - Keep system simple with just permanent health and healing.

## üéØ Initiative and Action Timing

### Question 2.1: Initiative System [MODIFIED FOR REAL-TIME]

**RECOMMENDED ANSWERS:**

Since this is REAL-TIME with environmental ticks, traditional initiative doesn't apply. Instead:

3. **Player Action Priority**: Players can act any time between ticks, actions resolve in order submitted.

4. **Tied Actions**: Resolved by Tactics skill, then random.

5. **Action Types**:
   - **Fast**: Simple attacks, movement, item use (1 tick)
   - **Normal**: Complex attacks, short spells (2 ticks)
   - **Slow**: Powerful spells, special abilities (3+ ticks)
