## 🎯 Core Innovation: Dual-Tier Progression System

The story-writer-dm has solved the classic roguelike permadeath problem with an innovative two-tier system:

### Character Progression (Lost on Death)
- **Character Skills**: 0-100 per skill
- **Equipment**: All gear lost on death
- **Temporary Power**: Represents current run's strength
- **Quick Recovery**: New characters start with inherited knowledge

### Account Progression (Permanent)
- **Account Knowledge**: 0-1000+ never lost
- **Meta Unlocks**: New skills, starting bonuses, regions
- **Achievement System**: Permanent rewards for milestones
- **Social Recognition**: Titles and cosmetics persist

### Inheritance System
- New characters inherit **10% of account knowledge as starting skill points**
- Example: 500 account knowledge = 50 starting skill points to distribute
- Creates meaningful progression without removing permadeath stakes

## 🗺️ World Structure Design

### Static World Map
- **Persistent Towns**: Safe zones for preparation
- **Region Progression**: Account-level unlocks
- **Known Landmarks**: Predictable navigation
- **Social Hubs**: 8-player party formation areas

- **Group Votes**: 6/8 required to enter high-risk areas

### Hybrid Zones
- **Static Entrance**: Known location on world map
- **Random Interior**: Different each visit

## ⚖️ Death & Revival Balance

### Solo Death in Group
- **Spectator Mode**: Continue watching party

## 🎮 8-Player Coordination with Permadeath

### Pre-Dungeon Planning
- **Risk Assessment Display**: Clear death probability
- **Resource Check**: Ensure revival supplies
- **Role Assignment**: Who takes point, who supports
- **Escape Planning**: Designated retreat coordinator

### During Dungeon
- **Death Prevention Priority**: Healing > damage
- **Resource Sharing**: Critical for survival
- **Communication Essential**: Death is permanent
- **Tactical Retreats**: Live to fight another day

### Post-Death Support
- **Account Knowledge Sharing**: Tips for rebuilding
- **Equipment Donations**: Help fallen players restart
