# Streamlined Roguelike System with Permadeath

**Category**: Core Game Architecture Redesign  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fundamental system changes required  
**Decision Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Designed By**: Story-Writer/DM (Game Balance Specialist)

## üî• NEW CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Based on the new client requirements, we need fundamental changes to the existing design:

### 1. **Roguelike with Permadeath**: Players lose ALL equipment on death
### 2. **Scalable Skill System**: Start simple (30-50 skills) but scale to "many dozens"
### 3. **World Structure**: Static world map + randomly generated dungeons
### 4. **Quick Deployment**: Streamlined for rapid testing
### 5. **ASCII Balance**: Review character system for permadeath implications

---

## üìä CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS ANALYSIS

### Permadeath Impact on Game Balance:
- **Equipment Loss**: Complete gear reset creates massive power swings
- **Skill Persistence**: What survives death becomes the core progression
- **Group Dynamics**: Death penalty affects 8-player coordination
- **Risk/Reward**: Balance between challenge and frustration

### Real-Time Ticks vs Permadeath:
- **Death Consequences**: Real-time environment can kill AFK players
- **Group Pressure**: Time pressure conflicts with careful play
- **AI Takeover**: AI mistakes could cause permanent character loss

### Scaling Challenges:
- **MVP to Dozens**: System must expand from 5-8 skills to 30+ skills
- **Balance Complexity**: More skills = exponential balance complexity
- **Implementation Path**: Clear upgrade route needed

---

## üéØ STREAMLINED SYSTEM PROPOSAL

### Core Design Philosophy:
**"Permadeath with Meaningful Progression"**
- Death is punishing but not devastating
- Account-level progression provides continuity
- Equipment is temporary, knowledge is permanent
- 8-player groups reduce individual risk

---

## üíÄ PERMADEATH SYSTEM DESIGN

### 1. **Death Penalties - Balanced Punishment**

```
ON CHARACTER DEATH:
‚úÖ LOST:
- All equipment and inventory
- Current character's accumulated combat experience
- Location progress in current dungeon

‚úÖ PRESERVED:
- Account-level skill knowledge (see progression system)
- Dungeon map discoveries (shared knowledge)
- Social connections and group standings
- Achievement unlocks and meta-progression
```

### 2. **Revival vs New Character**

```
DEATH RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
A) REVIVAL (Group Decision):
   - Requires 6/8 party vote
   - Costs significant group resources
   - Revived character returns with basic gear
   - 50% skill experience penalty for current session

B) NEW CHARACTER (Default):
   - Create new character immediately
   - Inherits account knowledge (see progression)
   - Starts with basic gear appropriate to account level
   - No skill penalty, fresh start
```

### 3. **Group Death Mitigation**

```
8-PLAYER DEATH MECHANICS:
- Individual death: Character removed, player continues as observer
- 50% party death: Group retreat option with penalties
- 75% party death: Automatic retreat, session ends
- Total party wipe: All players create new characters
```

---

## üìà TWO-TIER SKILL PROGRESSION

### **Tier 1: Character Skills (Lost on Death)**
```
CHARACTER-BOUND PROGRESSION:
- Combat effectiveness in current session
- Equipment proficiency bonuses
- Tactical abilities and combo moves
- Temporary buffs and session bonuses

RANGE: 0-100 per skill
ADVANCEMENT: Use-based, rapid progression
DEATH IMPACT: Completely reset to 0
```

### **Tier 2: Account Knowledge (Persistent)**
```
ACCOUNT-BOUND PROGRESSION:
- Skill Knowledge Points (SKP) - never lost
- Unlocked abilities and techniques
- Strategic knowledge and dungeon lore
- Advanced character creation options

RANGE: 0-1000+ Knowledge Points per skill area
ADVANCEMENT: Slower, milestone-based progression
DEATH IMPACT: Always preserved
```

### **Integration Example:**
```
NEW CHARACTER CREATION:
Base Character Skill = floor(Account Knowledge / 10)

Example:
- Account has 250 Magic Knowledge Points
- New character starts with 25 Magic skill
- Can rapidly advance to previous session levels
- Plus access to unlocked spells/abilities
```
