## MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT

### AUTOMATED ALERTS
- **Yellow Alert**: No Context7 usage for 2 days → 24-hour check-in
- **Red Alert**: No Context7 usage for 3 days → Immediate intervention
- **Critical Alert**: Quality gate failures → Performance improvement plan
- **Team Alert**: <80% adoption rate → Executive notification

### SUCCESS METRICS
- **Individual**: ≥85% competency scores, daily usage, implementation success
- **Team**: 100% certification rate, 25% velocity improvement, 40% bug reduction
- **Quality**: Reduced code review cycles, improved documentation standards

### ESCALATION PROCEDURES
