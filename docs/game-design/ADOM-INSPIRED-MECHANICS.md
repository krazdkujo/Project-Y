# ADOM-Inspired Mechanics for MUD Tick System

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Based on**: Research-specialist analysis of ADOM (Ancient Domains of Mystery)  
**Purpose**: Adapt proven ADOM mechanics to MUD-inspired real-time coordination

---

## üéÆ Core ADOM Principles Applied

### 1. Action Economy Adaptation
**ADOM Original**: Pure turn-based where each action consumes one turn
**MUD Adaptation**: Action point system where different actions cost different ticks

```yaml
Action Costs (in ticks):
  Movement: 1 tick
  Basic Attack: 2 ticks
  Power Attack: 3 ticks
  Skill Use: 3-5 ticks
  Cast Spell: 4-6 ticks
  Use Item: 1-2 ticks
  Rest/Wait: 1 tick
  Search: 2 ticks
```

**Benefits**: 
- Maintains ADOM's tactical depth
- Allows real-time coordination for multi-player
- Creates natural action priority system

### 2. Command Efficiency (Direct from ADOM)
**Single-Key Commands** for maximum efficiency:

```yaml
Movement:
  hjkl: vi-style directional movement
  yubn: diagonal movement
  numpad: alternative directional controls

Combat:
  f: fight/attack
  r: ranged attack  
  g: guard/defend
  shift+direction: run until obstacle

Items:
  a: apply/use item
  d: drop item
  e: eat food
  q: quaff potion
  r: read scroll
  w: wield weapon
  W: wear armor

Skills:
  s: skill menu
  hotkeys: direct skill activation (customizable)

Utility:
  o: open door/container
  c: close door
  l: look/examine
  i: inventory
  <: go up stairs
  >: go down stairs
  .: rest/wait
```

### 3. Skill Training Philosophy
**ADOM Method**: Skills improve through use with diminishing returns
**Our Implementation**: 
```
Use-Based Training:
- Each skill use has chance to improve
- Chance decreases as skill level increases
- Different actions train different skills
- Cross-training penalties prevent exploitation

Training Rates:
Levels 0-25:   20% improvement chance per use
Levels 25-50:  15% improvement chance per use  
Levels 50-75:  10% improvement chance per use
Levels 75-100: 5% improvement chance per use
```

### 4. Character Attributes (ADOM-Style)
**Six Core Attributes** (simplified from ADOM's 9):
```yaml
Strength (St):     # Melee damage, carry capacity
  affects: [combat_damage, encumbrance, weapon_requirements]
  
Dexterity (Dx):    # Speed, accuracy, dodging
  affects: [hit_chance, dodge_chance, missile_accuracy, action_speed]
  
Constitution (Co): # Health, healing, poison resistance  
  affects: [max_health, healing_rate, disease_resistance]
  
Intelligence (In): # Spell power, skill learning
  affects: [mana_points, spell_damage, skill_training_speed]
  
Wisdom (Wi):       # Spell defense, perception
  affects: [spell_resistance, detection_chance, mana_regeneration]
  
Charisma (Ch):     # Social interactions, leadership
  affects: [npc_reactions, party_coordination, morale]
```

**Training Attributes**:
- Train through relevant activities (ADOM style)
- Slow natural improvement over time
- Account progression unlocks higher training caps

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System Adaptation

### ADOM Combat Philosophy
**"Preparation over Reflexes"** - Success depends on:
- Equipment choices
- Tactical positioning  
- Resource management
- Environmental awareness

### Combat Resolution (ADOM-Inspired)
```typescript
// Hit chance calculation
hit_chance = base_chance + skill_modifier + weapon_bonus + attribute_bonus
base_chance = 50% // reasonable success chance
skill_modifier = floor(skill_level / 4) // 0-25 bonus
weapon_bonus = weapon.accuracy // varies by weapon type
attribute_bonus = floor(dexterity / 4) // 0-6 typical bonus

// Damage calculation  
damage = weapon_base + strength_bonus + skill_bonus - armor_reduction
weapon_base = weapon.damage // 1d4 to 2d6 typical
strength_bonus = floor(strength / 4) 
skill_bonus = floor(combat_skill / 10) // 0-10 bonus
armor_reduction = armor.protection + floor(constitution / 6)

// Critical hits
critical_chance = weapon.crit_chance + floor(skill_level / 20)
critical_multiplier = 2.0 + (skill_level / 100) // 2.0x to 3.0x
```

### Tactical Elements (From ADOM)
```yaml
Positioning:
  - Ranged advantage (attack from distance)
  - Chokepoints (limit enemy approaches)
  - Flanking (attack from multiple directions)
  - High ground (bonus to accuracy and defense)

Equipment Switching:
  - Slashing weapons vs unarmored
  - Piercing weapons vs armored  
  - Blunt weapons vs skeletons
  - Silver weapons vs undead

Resource Management:
  - Limited healing potions
  - Ammunition conservation  
  - Spell components
  - Food and rest requirements
```

## üè∞ Dungeon Design (ADOM Approach)

### ADOM Dungeon Philosophy
**Hybrid Structure**: Fixed special areas + procedural standard areas
**Persistent Generation**: Levels don't change when revisited
**Themed Progression**: Different areas have distinct challenges

### Our Dungeon System
```yaml
Level Structure (MVP):
  1-2: Tutorial Levels
    monsters: [goblin, rat, kobold]
    loot: [basic_weapons, healing_potions, simple_armor]
    hazards: [pit_traps, locked_doors]
    
  3-5: Standard Levels  
    monsters: [orc, hobgoblin, wolf, spider]
    loot: [good_weapons, magic_potions, chain_armor]
    hazards: [dart_traps, poison_gas, darkness]
    
  6-8: Dangerous Levels
    monsters: [troll, ogre, wraith, fire_elemental] 
    loot: [rare_weapons, powerful_potions, plate_armor]
    hazards: [teleport_traps, cursed_items, energy_drain]
    
  9: Boss Preparation
    monsters: [elite_guards, boss_minions, champions]
    loot: [legendary_weapons, master_potions, magical_armor]
    hazards: [death_traps, illusions, time_pressure]
    
  10: Final Boss
    monsters: [unique_boss, boss_forms, final_guardians]
    loot: [artifact_weapons, victory_rewards, rare_materials]
    hazards: [environmental_changes, escalating_difficulty]
```

### Room Generation (ADOM-Style)
```yaml
Room Types:
  combat_room: 60%        # 1-3 enemies, minimal loot
  treasure_room: 15%      # loot focus, minimal enemies  
  trap_room: 10%          # hazards, skill challenges
  empty_room: 10%         # rest opportunities, hidden secrets
  special_room: 5%        # unique encounters, story elements

Room Features:
  - Multiple entrances when possible
  - Environmental interactions
  - Hidden secrets (20% of rooms)
  - Tactical positioning options
  - Risk/reward choices
```

  completion: 100 points per full dungeon run
  
New Character Benefits:
  starting_skills: floor(knowledge_points / 20)
  equipment_quality: knowledge_tier unlocks
  attribute_bonuses: small permanent improvements
  special_abilities: unlock unique starting powers
```

### Learning Modes (ADOM-Inspired)
```yaml
Practice Mode:
  - Save/restore allowed for learning
  - Reduced stakes for experimentation
