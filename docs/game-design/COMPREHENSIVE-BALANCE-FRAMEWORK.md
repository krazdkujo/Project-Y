## Balance Framework Philosophy

### Power Scaling Principles

#### 1. Linear Base Progression
```yaml
Skill Level Impact:
- 0-25: Basic competency, fundamental techniques
- 26-50: Intermediate mastery, enhanced effectiveness
- 51-75: Advanced techniques, specialized abilities
- 76-100: Master-level skills, legendary techniques

Damage Scaling Formula:
Base_Damage + (Skill_Level / scaling_factor) + Equipment_Bonus + Ability_Modifier

Where scaling_factor varies by weapon type:
- Fast weapons (daggers): Higher scaling factor (lower per-level gain)
- Slow weapons (maces, axes): Lower scaling factor (higher per-level gain)
```

#### 2. AP Economy Balance
```yaml
AP Generation: 2 per turn + 3 carryover maximum = 5 AP pool
AP Distribution Philosophy:
- Free Actions: Provide baseline effectiveness, always available
- 1-2 AP Abilities: Enhance basic actions, frequent use
- 3-4 AP Abilities: Tactical choices, moderate commitment
- 5-6 AP Abilities: Strategic decisions, significant commitment
- 7-8 AP Abilities: Ultimate techniques, rare deployment

Resource Management Strategies:
- Conservative: Use free actions, save AP for defense
- Balanced: Mix free actions with low-cost abilities
- Aggressive: Save AP for high-impact abilities
- Coordinated: Synchronize AP spending with team
```

#### 3. Rarity and Power Correlation
```yaml
Equipment Power Curve:
Common -> Uncommon: 25% power increase
Uncommon -> Rare: 35% power increase  
Rare -> Epic: 50% power increase
Epic -> Legendary: 75% power increase
Legendary -> Artifact: 100% power increase

Special Abilities by Rarity:
- Common: No special abilities, reliable performance
- Uncommon: 1 minor special ability
- Rare: 1-2 moderate special abilities
- Epic: 2-3 significant special abilities
- Legendary: 3+ powerful special abilities
- Artifact: Unique game-changing abilities
```

### Balance Validation Metrics

#### 1. DPS (Damage Per Second) Curves
```yaml
Weapon Type Balance Targets:
- Daggers: High DPS, low per-hit damage
- Swords: Balanced DPS and versatility
- Axes: High burst DPS, moderate sustained
- Maces: High per-hit damage, lower DPS
- Bows: High sustained ranged DPS
- Crossbows: High burst ranged damage
- Staves: Enhanced spell DPS

Target DPS Ranges by Skill Level:
- Level 0-25: 8-15 DPS
- Level 26-50: 15-25 DPS

```

#### 2. Survivability Metrics
```yaml
Armor Value Progression:
- Light Armor: 2-10 armor value, high evasion
- Medium Armor: 5-18 armor value, balanced stats
- Heavy Armor: 8-30 armor value, high protection
- Shields: 2-15 additional block value

Effective HP Calculation:
Base_HP + (Armor_Value * damage_reduction_factor) + (Evasion_Chance * avoidance_multiplier)

Target Effective HP by Level:
- Level 0-25: 120-180 effective HP
- Level 26-50: 180-280 effective HP
- Level 51-75: 280-450 effective HP  
- Level 76-100: 450-700 effective HP
```

#### 3. Action Economy Efficiency
```yaml
Actions Per Turn Targets:
- High Initiative Builds: 1.5-2.0 effective actions
- Balanced Builds: 1.0-1.5 effective actions
- Tank Builds: 0.8-1.2 effective actions

AP Efficiency Ratings:
- Free Actions: Baseline (1.0x efficiency)

## Economic Balance

### Item Valuation System

#### 1. Base Value Calculation
```yaml
Weapon Values:
Base_Value = (Average_Damage * 15) + (Accuracy_Bonus * 8) + (Special_Properties * 200)

Armor Values:
Base_Value = (Armor_Value * 20) + (Secondary_Stats * 10) + (Special_Properties * 150)

Consumable Values:
Base_Value = (Effect_Strength * Usage_Frequency * Rarity_Multiplier)

Material Values:
Base_Value = (Crafting_Tier * 50) + (Skill_Requirement * 5) + (Rarity_Bonus)
```

#### 2. Market Dynamics
```yaml
Supply and Demand Factors:
- Common items: Readily available, stable prices
- Uncommon items: Moderate availability, slight premium
- Rare items: Limited availability, significant premium
- Epic+ items: Rare drops/crafting only, luxury pricing

Crafting Economics:
- Material cost + skill investment + time = Base crafting cost
- Success chance affects final value
- Master crafters can charge premium for services
- Bulk production reduces per-unit costs
```

### Resource Management

#### 1. Inventory and Storage
```yaml
Carry Capacity Limits:
- Base capacity: 20 item slots
- Athletics skill: +1 slot per 10 levels
- Bag of Holding: +100 slots (epic item)
- Guild storage: Shared space for teams

Weight Considerations:
- Heavy armor and weapons reduce movement
- Athletics skill mitigates weight penalties
- Strategic item selection important for builds
- Pack animals and carts for exploration
```

#### 2. Consumable Balance
```yaml
Healing Item Scaling:
- Level 1-25 content: Basic healing potions sufficient
- Level 26-50 content: Greater healing potions needed
- Level 51-75 content: Superior potions and magic required
- Level 76-100 content: Legendary healing methods

Combat Item Usage:
- Damage consumables: Supplement but don't replace abilities
- Buff items: Temporary advantages for key moments
- Utility items: Problem-solving tools
- Emergency items: Expensive but life-saving options
```
