## Purpose
Character management system handling character creation, skill progression (34 skills), and abilities integration for the single-player party-based ASCII roguelike. Manages up to 6 party members with individual progression and permadeath mechanics.

## Key Files
- `generator/CharacterGenerator.js` - Character creation interface with skill allocation and weapon selection

- `skills/SkillSystem.js` - 34-skill progression system with use-based advancement and mastery levels
- `skills/SkillCategories.js` - Skill category definitions and structure
- `skills/SKILL_SUMMARIES.js` - Comprehensive skill descriptions and unlock requirements

## Dependencies
- Internal: `../core/EventSystem.js`, `../core/GameState.js`, `../equipment/Weapons.js`, `../abilities/core/AbilityEngine.js`
- External: UUID for unique character ID generation

## Integration Points
**Character Creation System**:
- 25 skill points allocation across 34 available skills

## Critical Fix Applied (2025-08-27)
**Character Generation Dependencies Resolved**: Fixed critical issue where CharacterGenerator was failing due to missing system instances. EventSystem, SkillSystem, and WeaponSystem are now properly instantiated in main.js before CharacterGenerator initialization, enabling full character creation functionality.
