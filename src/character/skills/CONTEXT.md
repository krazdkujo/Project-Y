# Folder Context: character/skills

## Purpose
Skill system managing 34+ skills across weapon, armor, magic, combat, and crafting categories. Implements use-based progression with exponential XP curves, providing the foundation for ability unlocking and scaling in the tactical ASCII roguelike.

## Key Files
- `SkillSystem.js` - Core progression system with XP calculation, level tracking, and use-based advancement
- `SkillCategories.js` - Comprehensive skill definitions across 7 categories with 34+ individual skills
- `SKILL_SUMMARIES.js` - Documentation of all skills with descriptions and progression details

## Dependencies

### Internal  
- `../../core/EventSystem.js` - Skill level change notifications and character progression events
- `../../abilities/core/AbilityEngine.js` - Skill requirements for ability unlocking and scaling
- `../abilities/AbilitySystem.js` - Character-specific ability integration

### External
- No external dependencies - pure JavaScript implementation

## Integration Points

### Ability System Integration
- Skills determine ability availability through level requirements
- Skill levels provide scaling multipliers for ability effectiveness
- Using abilities awards 1 XP to associated skills (use-based progression)
- Higher skill levels reduce AP costs for abilities

### Character Progression  
- All characters start with level 0 in all skills
- Progressive XP requirements: early levels 10-20 uses, high levels 200+ uses
- No character levels - entirely skill-based advancement system
- Mastery rankings: Novice â†’ Skilled â†’ Adept â†’ Expert â†’ Master â†’ Grandmaster

### Combat Integration
- Combat skills affect damage, accuracy, and defensive capabilities
- Weapon skills scale with equipment effectiveness
- Magic skills determine spell power and success rates
- Defensive skills provide damage reduction and survivability

## Skill Categories Structure

### Weapon Skills (8 skills)

## XP Progression Design

### Level Brackets
- **Levels 1-10:** 10-30 uses per level (quick early progression)
- **Levels 11-30:** 30-130 uses per level (moderate progression)  
- **Levels 31-60:** 100-400 uses per level (steady advancement)
- **Levels 61-100:** 200-1000 uses per level (mastery grind)

### Use-Based Philosophy
- Every skill use awards exactly 1 XP (no bonuses or penalties)
- Natural progression through gameplay activities
- No artificial level caps or restrictions
- Encourages diverse skill development

## Architecture Notes

### Skill Object Structure
```javascript
{
  level: number,    // Current skill level (0-100)
  xp: number,      // Total XP accumulated  
  uses: number,    // Total times skill was used
  lastUsed: timestamp // Last use timestamp
}
```

### Category Organization
Skills are organized into logical categories for UI presentation and progression tracking, with cross-category synergies supported.

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient XP calculation with pre-computed requirements array
- Minimal memory footprint per character skill object
- Event-driven updates to prevent unnecessary recalculations
